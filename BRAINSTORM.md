Goal: Use my money wisely.

## How:

1. Need to know how my much of my spending is mandatory vs. discretionary.
2. Need to know much much I'm saving.
3. Need to categorize spending, and see how much I've spent per month on each category.
4. Need to set a budget (spending limit per category) for each month.

## Some notes:

1. For every expenditure, you can sub-categorize pieces of it.
2. You don't have to categorize each expenditure, but it will automatically go into a catch-all category called "Uncategorized".
3. Expenditures can form a tree.


## Some language
